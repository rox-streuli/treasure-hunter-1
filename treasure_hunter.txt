# Introduction
print("""You are a treasure hunter searching for the biggest treasure of your
 life. You passed the last three years following a trail of clues from Europe
  to the Pacific Ocean. 

The Pirate Black Hat was not your first choice. Nobody thinks he was very 
successful in accumulating an immense treasure. Still, three years ago, you 
came across a manuscript from a reliable historian stating that he was very 
well known in the Pacific, not in the Atlantic.

The manuscript describes some of his early sightings in the far corners of the 
Pacific, confirming his stories as accurate and leaving the name of a small 
island you had never heard before, Tora.
""")

print(island_ascii)

# Setting
print("""It has been three days since you arrived in Tora. The local tribe has 
a legend about a fortress deep in the jungle. Pirates would be seen walking 
towards the mountains at dusk and disappear for weeks. 

The mountains would come alive at that time. The roar of a terrifying creature 
could be heard from the distance, and eyes of fire would appear on the side of
 the Ahâ€™ai mountain, keeping most of the island's inhabitants away. The pirates 
 would kill anyone who dared to follow them and learn their secrets, so the 
 tribe learned to close themself in their huts and stay there until dawn.

With time, the facts were lost and converted into bedtime stories for children.
 They talk about a pirate with a black hat that would make anyone not in their
  bed after sundown disappear.

So here you are, deep in the jungle of Tora, near the Ahâ€™ai mountain and 
searching for the famous lost treasure of the pirate Black Hat.
""")

# Start game
jungle = input("""To the right, a narrow path wanders off toward the Ahâ€™ai 
mountains. To the left, you can hear the sound of water.

Write â€˜mountainâ€™ if you want to take the path to the Ah'ai mountain.
Write â€˜waterâ€™ if you want to go towards the water.
Write â€˜quitâ€™ to exit.\n
""").lower()

mountain = """The path is narrow, and the trees cover the sun's light. You 
walk for the entire day, always uphill. The steep trail is treacherous, and 
often, you lose your step in the dark. You lose your flashlight in one of 
your falls, and now you are using your phone as a light source, spending 
valuable battery life.

Suddenly, you see the mouth of a cavern almost invisible to the side of your 
path. Carved around its entrance, warnings in the form of hanging skulls. And 
you think, what better than the mountains to guard a treasure? You are deep in
 the Ahâ€™ai mountains now, but you continue walking, illuminating your path
  with your smartphone.

You are smart enough to leave a trail of marks in the walls of your path to 
be able to find your way back. But it is taking too long, and you wonder if 
you should head back and recharge your phone in the sunlight before it dies, 
but it is too late. Your phone runs off battery. 

Darkness surrounds you, and you cannot see if you are still walking the trail.
 You lose your footing and fall to the entrains of the mountains. You are 
 lost forever. That is not how you wanted it to end.
"""

water = """A river follows the jungle's edge a short distance from the clearing.
 Your instinct was correct. You can see the mountains from here. The terrain 
 is too steep to allow a fortress to be nested between them.

You can see an old raft across the river, with a liana connecting the raft 
with a tree on your side. It is covered in ivy but is still afloat.

You consider how deep the river is and how likely it is to manage to swim 
across. The river is only 100 metres wide, and you are a good swimmer. 
The current does not look strong, and you are very hot after walking.

Write â€˜raftâ€™ to choose the floating wooden structure.
Write â€˜swimâ€™ to cross the river and refresh yourself.
Write â€˜quitâ€™ to exit.
 \n
"""

swim = """The water is perfect, shallow with a weak current. You start
 swimming leisurely, enjoying its temperature, advancing fast towards 
 the other side.

You are halfway when you see something fast approaching your position. You
 start swimming more quickly, but the creature reaches you before reaching 
 the river bank. You can see it now. It is a gigantic python that wraps 
 around you tight. While it exerts its force constricting you, you can see
  his head getting near, opening his enormous jaw, ready to swallow you whole. 
"""

raft = """You unwrap the end of the liana from the tree and give a tentative 
tug, and the raft moves, reacting to it. You try harder again, and the raft 
separates from the opposite bank, breaking the ivy. Steadily, you pull the 
liana, making the raft get near you. It only takes you 10 minutes. 

You check the raft structure. It looks strong enough to support your weight 
and cross the river, and there is also a pair of oars on the raft.

Once safely on the raft, you start rowing slowly. The current is not strong,
 and you cross the river faster than you estimated.

On the other side of the river, you find a path leading you around the slopes
 of the Ahâ€™ai mountains. You walk for the entire day, but eventually, the
  trail ends. Hidden between the jungle foliage, you spot a cave in front of you.

The entrance is the size of a house door, but once you walk through, it 
opens into a massive chamber. Stalactites decorate the cavern's ceiling. 
At the far end, you can see three doors, each painted in a different colour: 
red, blue, and yellow.

Write â€˜redâ€™ for the red door.
Write â€˜blueâ€™ for the blue door.
Write â€˜yellowâ€™ for the yellow door.
Write â€˜quitâ€™ to exit.
\n
"""

red = """The red door feels warm in your hand. You open the door and see
 a light at the end of the long corridor. You walk carefully, but suddenly,
  the floor crumbles under your feet. You start falling toward what looks 
  like hot lava running in the mountain centre. It is not possible, you think,
   the volcano is extinct. But there is no denying where you are heading 
   towards a scorching end.
"""

blue = """The blue door leads you to a labyrinth. You are wise to mark the 
walls with numbers to track your path, so if you return to the same corridor,
 you will know where to go.
The labyrinth leads you deep into the mountain. There seems to be no end. 
Suddenly, you hear a roar. It bounces back from every direction, making it 
impossible to know from where it comes.

You start running back, fearing to be face to face with the owner of that sound.
 But there is no way out. The corridor suddenly closes in front of you, and you
  are trapped. The creature is near now. You can hear its roar just at the end 
  of the corridor. Your fate is imminent, and there is no escape. This will be 
  your tomb.
"""

yellow = """You choose yellow. It is on the right, and your instinct tells you 
that it leads toward the river side of the mountain, where the tribe says eyes 
of fire watch over them.

You walk for miles, more than the distance between the river and the hidden 
entrance. You can see drops of water falling from the ceiling, making you 
think you are under the river. But the long corridor continues.

Finally, there is light ahead. Ten metres more, you reach a cavern with 
treasure chests illuminated with lava from a pit. Two big holes on the side
 wall show a starry sky, the eyes of fire. You found the treasure!
"""

quit_game = """You are tired and starting to doubt yourself about all this. You 
are alone, and although the research was exciting, you are scared of what 
lies ahead. Stories of beasts and fire do not sound so appealing now. You 
return to the tribe village and ask for help and extra equipment."""
